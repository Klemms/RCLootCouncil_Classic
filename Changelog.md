## Changes

### Always auto award list

Located in `.../Core/Classes/Lists.lua` is table of itemIDs you can edit to always have certain items auto awarded.

### TradeUI

Implemented hotfix for handling duplicate items.
Not as robust as I would like, but it should get the job done for now.

### Burning Crusade Classic

Updated .toc for patch 2.5.3.

Added `Heart of Darkness` and `Mark of the Illidari` to the rep items loot list.


### Bugfixes

* *Fixed issue with `/rc remove` command.*
