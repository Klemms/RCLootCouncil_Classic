## Additions
### Auto Award Reputation Items
Added a new auto award section for reputation items. These currently includes Coins and Bijous from Zul'Gurub.
They can be auto awarded two ways:
1. To a specfied player, just as the other auto awards.
2. In a round robin fashion, in which all players will get one before anyone getting a second.

Note that the Master Looter will still have to loot the mobs in either case.

### Group Loot
Added support for usage with group loot.
The group leader must enable this in the `Usage Options`.
When enabled, the group leader is treated as the Master Looter for all intents and purposes.
The group leader will still need to loot all mobs to have items added to a session, but doesn't need to keep the loot list open to award items.
**Note:** This addition only facilitates the use of RCLootCouncil with group loot, but does nothing to circumvent the limitations of said loot method.
