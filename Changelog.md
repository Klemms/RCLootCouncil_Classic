## Changes

Updated for Wrath of the Lich King Classic.  
This includes adding Death Knights to the auto pass table, but there might be other stuff I've forgotten - feel free to reach out if you find anything.

### Bugfixes

* *TradeUI should now properly handle reawards.*
* *Doing a `/reload` should no longer incorrectly remove items marked for "award later" or "trade".*
* *When using the `Observe` feature, voting frame could throw an error if certain comms was received out of order (CurseClassic#169).*
